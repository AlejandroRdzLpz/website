View from my desk at my new job. Going to be doing development on University systems and creating content to teach people how to use it.

Huge thanks to @gilbertjgonzales @felipe and @Frances Coronel for taking the time out of their busy day to talk to me 1-on-1 about school, career and personal aspirations and goals. ❤️
