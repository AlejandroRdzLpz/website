Leads can include but are not limited to:

- Staff
- Board members

- Chapter directors
- Committee members
- Social media volunteers

## Standards

Generally speaking, we hope that our leads aim to find consensus even when there are disagreements and keeping a professional attitude. You should try and hold your peers accountable with constructive feedback before escalating it further.

### Examples of behavior by Techqueria leads that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Representing Techqueria with **external partners** or stakeholders in a professional and courteous way
  - A good reference would be how you would communicate with a professor or teacher
- Communicating with **members** as a representative of Techqueria in a professional and courteous way
  - A good reference would be how you would communicate with a fellow co-worker you feel neutral about
- Encouraging members to follow the Code of Conduct
  - Remind members that this is a professional community and that we foster respect and inclusion
- Following our [Social Media Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Social-Media-Guidelines-6334c264bda74d6c88b6994142ee8b3b) when posting content to any Techqueria accounts

## Reporting Violations

If you feel a lead has violated the Leaders Code of Conduct, please let the board know by emailing [board@techqueria.org](mailto:board@techqueria.org).

If you feel a lead has violated Techqueria's Code of Conduct, please report that to the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety) as outlined in our [Code of Conduct](/coc/).

If you are a board member and you feel another board member has violated the Leaders Code of Conduct, you must report it in accordance with the board bylaws.

## Enforcement

Any lead found in violation of the Leaders Code of Conduct will be dealt with as follows:

- 1 violation - warning from a staff member
- 2 violations - second warning from a board member
- 3 violations - off-boarded as leader

This excludes Code of Conduct violations which are governed by the Trust & Safety Committee and are dealt with separately. If a lead is found in violation of the Code of Conduct, they must be treated the same way as a member unless otherwise noted.

### Chapter Volunteer

If a volunteer for a local chapter is found in violation of the Code of Conduct, that should be reported to the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety/).

## Code of Conduct

Chapter Directors must adhere to the official Techqueria [Code of Conduct](/coc/) at all times, online or offline.

The Code of Conduct applies to **ALL** members of Techqueria, including leads, while the Leaders Code of Conduct applies only to Techqueria leads.
