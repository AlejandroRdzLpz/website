## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Acceptable Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Referring to people by their gender pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain

## Unacceptable Behavior

Techqueria is a professional organization so the best reference for how to behave is how you would with fellow co-workers in the workplace. If your behavior is not appropriate for the workplace, it's not appropriate for Techqueria.

Depending on the severity of the violation, the person will either be given a warning or kicked out immediately.

If the person has been reported 3 or more times over the past 12 months, the person will be banned regardless of the severity of any of their violations.

## Alcohol

For all official Techqueria events, in instances where alcohol is present, the following is required:

- All attendees must have IDs checked to confirm they are 21+
- Alcohol consumption must be limited. Local chapters maintain autonomy for how to implement alcohol control measures (drink tickets, wristbands, etc)
- Additionally, it is at the local chapter‚Äôs discretion how to handle alcohol at casual events

## Techqueria Leads

All Techqueria leads are expected to follow both the Code of Conduct and the Leaders Code of Conduct.

If you feel a Techqueria lead (director, chapter lead, volunteer lead, board member, etc.) has violated the Code of Conduct, please report that violation.

## Reporting Violations

In the unfortunate case that you see someone violating the code of conduct, there are 2 ways that you can report it to us.

Members **must** submit a report in order to start an investigation.

Directly messaging an admin or member of the Techqueria team does not start an investigation.

### Report via Website Form

You can submit violations on our website at https://techqueria.org/report-violation

### Report via Slack

Within the Slack group, you can join the¬†`#meta`¬†channel and use the "Report a COC Violation" workflow which sends a message to a private channel called `#meta-coc-reports` that only the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety/) has access to.

From there, the committee will follow up with the reporter via Slack as they conduct an investigation and determine next steps.

## Enforcement

Techqueria's [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety/) is responsible for overseeing Code of Conduct violations.

After someone reports a violation, the report will be reviewed and investigated in private by the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety/) and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

A member of this committee will approach anyone identified as participating in harassing behavior and asked to cease any inappropriate activity or to disengage from our community immediately.

It is important to note that the US Constitution protects the right to free speech, but only from infringement by the government itself. It does not protect free speech in a private setting, such as the Techqueria community.

Techqueria holds the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Respect is essential for everybody so if you feel uncomfortable, or suspect of someone‚Äôs behavior, approach one of the organizers and staff members, we will handle it with confidentiality and care.

### When In Doubt

Techqueria's mission is to provide Latinx professionals with the resources and support that they need to thrive and become leaders in the tech industry.

**When in doubt,** the mission of Techqueria should guide decisions of whether or not to ban a member.

Is this member helping to contribute to Techqueria's mission through their actions?

### Timeline

Investigations should be reviewed and enforced within 30 days or less.

If an investigation takes 31 days or more, they must be escalated in accordance to the [Committees](/committees/) guidelines.

### Cool Down Period

- After someone is banned, their cool-down period is 1 year starting from when they were banned.
- Members who have been banned can ask to rejoin again after their cool-down period ends.
- Techqueria is not responsible for reaching out when cool-down periods ends. Members must ask themselves.

### Slack

- You cannot ban a member from a single channel, only the entire Workspace.
- Members who have been banned from the Slack community are also banned from in-person events and will be asked to leave if they are present.
- If a banned member attempts to re-join the Slack community using a different alias, email, etc and is discovered, their cool-down period is extended by 1 year.
